# Voting Room
Project files for a simple Voting Room app built using Blazor and SignalR. An explanation of how it was built and how it works can be found on my blog: [Learn how to communicate in real-time with Blazor and SignalR](https://tomjones.dev/blog/learn-how-to-communicate-in-real-time-with-blazor-and-signalr/).

The full version of the app is available at [https://votingroom.tomjones.dev](https://votingroom.tomjones.dev/).
